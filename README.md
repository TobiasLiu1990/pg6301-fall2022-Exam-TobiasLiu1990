#### Catering business

* Tried to use the generated GitHub Classroom repo that was generated from the exam text ( https://classroom.github.com/a/qa5zyqOy ).
* But it did not work. After trying multiple times to connect to it either by creating from GitHub repos or adding it from a new project, it did not work.
* It kept telling me that the repo does not exist. So i made my own repo for this exam.
* I have also chosen to run React 17 for this project.
